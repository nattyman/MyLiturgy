These may be imposed by making a sign of the cross on the forehead, or just a smudge. Or the ashes may be lightly sprinkled on the top of the head.The BAS appoints Ash Wednesday and the other weekdays of Lent and Holy Week, except the Feast of the Annunciation, as Days of Special Devotion.

Their lives and episcopal ministries otherwise diverged. Hence, in FAS Tsen and Sasaki are each accorded a separate set of Propers. If FAS is used, and a full commemoration of either is desired (i.e. proper readings and/or prayers), it may be appropriate to alternate their commemorations — for instance, Lindel Tsen in 2012 and Paul Sasaki in 2013."

This is a memorial of Christ’s entry into Jerusalem, the episode that marked the beginning of his Passover. But it also includes the reading (or singing) of a complete passion narrative (Matthew, Mark, or Luke according to the three–year cycle). This reading provides the narrative purpose of the week that follows, and dominates the celebration of the day itself, even when the celebration opens with the liturgy of the palms. To reflect this, the BAS gives this Sunday the newer title, “The Sunday of the Passion, with the Liturgy of the Palms.” It is interesting to note that the loss of the title “Palm Sunday” has been addressed in some places by calling the day “Palm Sunday of the Passion”. In one tradition the colour of the Liturgy of the Palms is red and that of the Eucharist, violet.",

    "subtitle": "Maundy Thursday There should be only one celebration of the Eucharist on Maundy Thursday, in the evening. The Triduum or the great Three Days, the heart of the Church’s liturgical year, begins with this liturgy and ends with Evening Prayer on Easter Day. (In some dioceses the bishop presides over a “Chrism Mass” in the Cathedral earlier on Maundy Thursday at which the oils of chrism and the sick are blessed and [in some places] clergy renew their ordination vows, reflecting the tradition that the ministerial priesthood was instituted by Our Lord on this day. For practical purposes this liturgy is sometimes transferred to another day in Holy Week or just before. (BAS p. 616.) The distinctive features of the Maundy Thursday liturgy in the parish church are the Institution of the Lord’s Supper and the washing of feet. Because the gift of the eucharist to the church must evoke a joyful response, even in Holy Week, the colour of this liturgy has customarily been white and Glory to God in the Highest has been sung to the accompaniment of bells, after which the tone becomes subdued, with the organ and bells silent until the Gloria reappears at the Great Vigil of Easter. Some find that this approach to Maundy Thursday interrupts the tone of Holy Week and anticipates in an unhelpful way the liturgical announcement of the Resurrection on Saturday night at the Vigil. If this is felt to be the case, red may be an appropriate colour for the celebration and the singing of Gloria and the use of bells omitted. Whichever option is chosen, it is possible to celebrate the centrality of the eucharist in the life of the church with unrestrained festivity on the feast of Corpus Christi, which is the Thursday after Trinity Sunday (usually transferred to the Sunday following). Corpus Christi is not on the Canadian Calendar, but is observed in a number of places in the Anglican Communion and propers are provided in this Order when the feast occurs.",

This is a memorial of Christ’s  entry into Jerusalem, the episode that marked the beginning of his  Passover.

This reading provides the narrative purpose of the week  that follows, and dominates the celebration of the day itself, even  when the celebration opens with the liturgy of the palms. To reflect  this, the BAS gives this Sunday the newer title, “The Sunday of the  Passion, with the Liturgy of the Palms.” It is interesting to note that  the loss of the title “Palm Sunday” has been addressed in some places  by calling the day “Palm Sunday of the Passion.” In one tradition the  colour of the Liturgy of the Palms is red and that of the Eucharist,  violet.",

If four are desired, an OT reading (in brackets) is provided at Evening Prayer, taken from Year 1 - See BAS p. 450. An Advent wreath may be erected in the Church with four candles (Rose for Advent 3 and Violet for the other Sundays). Each Sunday (beginning with First Evening Prayer), the appropriate number of candles is lit in advance of the liturgy.  A wide variety of prayers have been published to accompany this lighting. These can be useful in planning a liturgy for children, but can also overwhelm the Propers provided by the liturgy for Advent.  The lighting of the wreath in silence (perhaps by children) before the Service begins, is a very moving way to introduce the liturgy of the day.  In some places the candles are blue. A fifth candle (white) may be placed in the centre of the wreath to be lit Christmas Eve and throughout the Christmas Season.",

The reason seems to have been the memory of the two bishops together attending the 14th General Synod of the Canadian Church in 1937, even though China and Japan were then at war. Their lives and episcopal ministries otherwise diverged. Hence, in FAS Tsen and Sasaki are each accorded a separate set of propers. If FAS is used, and a full commemoration of either is desired (i.e., proper readings and/or prayers), it may be appropriate to alternate their commemorations -for instance, Lindel Tsen in 2014 and Paul Sasaki in 2015."

The imposition of ashes is an ancient way to begin the season of Lent. These are often made from branches of palms from the previous year’s Liturgy of the Palms that have been collected and burned, and the residue sifted and cooled, well in advance of Ash Wednesday services. These may be imposed by making a sign of the cross on the forehead, or just a smudge. Or the ashes may be lightly sprinkled on the top of the head. The BAS appoints Ash Wednesday and the other weekdays of Lent and Holy Week, except the Feast of the Annunciation, as Days of Special Devotion. These are observed by special acts of discipline and self–denial."

This is a memorial of Christ’s entry into Jerusalem, the episode that marked the beginning of his Passover. But it also includes the reading (or singing) of a complete passion narrative (Matthew, Mark, or Luke according to the three–year cycle). This reading provides the narrative purpose of the week that follows, and dominates the celebration of the day itself, even when the celebration opens with the liturgy of the palms. To reflect this, the BAS gives this Sunday the newer title, “The Sunday of the Passion, with the Liturgy of the Palms.” It is interesting to note that the loss of the title “Palm Sunday” has been addressed in some places by calling the day “Palm Sunday of the Passion.” In one tradition the colour of the Liturgy of the Palms is red and that of the Eucharist violet.",

This removal of ornaments and cloths from the church may be accompanied by the reading of Mt 26:30–46 and/or Ps 22.",
    "notes": "There should be only one celebration of the Eucharist on Maundy Thursday, in the evening. The Triduum or the great Three Days, the heart of the Church’s liturgical year, begins with this liturgy and ends with Evening Prayer on Easter Day. (In some dioceses the bishop presides over a “Chrism Mass” in the Cathedral earlier on Maundy Thursday at which the oils of chrism and the sick are blessed and [in some places] clergy renew their ordination vows, reflecting the tradition that the ministerial priesthood was instituted by Our Lord on this day. For practical purposes this liturgy is sometimes transferred to another day in Holy Week or just before (BAS p. 616). The distinctive features of the Maundy Thursday liturgy in the parish church are the Institution of the Lord’s Supper and the washing of feet. Because the gift of the Eucharist to the church must evoke a joyful response, even in Holy Week, the colour of this liturgy has customarily been white and Glory to God in the Highest has been sung to the accompaniment of bells, after which the tone becomes subdued, with the organ and bells silent until the Gloria reappears at the Great Vigil of Easter. Some find that this approach to Maundy Thursday interrupts the tone of Holy Week and anticipates in an unhelpful way the liturgical announcement of the Resurrection on Saturday night at the Vigil. If this is felt to be the case, red may be an appropriate colour for the celebration and the singing of Gloria and the use of bells omitted. Whichever option is chosen, it is possible to celebrate the centrality of the eucharist in the life of the church with unrestrained festivity on the feast of Corpus Christi, which is the Thursday after Trinity Sunday (usually transferred to the Sunday following). Corpus Christi is not on the Canadian Calendar, but is observed in a number of places in the Anglican Communion and propers are provided in this Order when the feast occurs."

    "notes": "Rogation Days and Ember Days: the three days before Ascension Day were for many centuries designated as days of special prayer and supplication (“rogare”) for the “seeds sown.” In Canada, with many different climatic zones, a fixed date for such prayer may not always be relevant, hence the BAS does not insist on our keeping to the traditional dates. Another more locally appropriate time may be chosen. However, the agricultural theme of the Rogation Days has in recent years been expanded to include concern for the environment more generally, and so a commonly held season for liturgical expression of such concern may be desirable. Keeping the traditional days after Easter 5 would seem to address this new insight very well. The liturgical colour may be of the season (white in Eastertide) or violet (the traditional colour of supplication and penitence). The Ember Days of solemn prayer and fasting are traditionally kept at the turn of the four seasons (Wednesday, Friday and Saturday after Advent 3, Lent 1; the Day of Pentecost and Holy Cross Day). The origins of the tradition are obscure, but in time Ember Days came to be associated almost entirely with solemn prayer for ordinands. In this case the BAS suggests they do not need to be kept at the traditional times, but in relation to local diocesan ordination arrangements. The Ember Days, like Rogation Days, have been de-emphasized in liturgical revision since the 1970s, but there seems to be a reviving sense of their pastoral usefulness. They can be helpful in engaging the church in intentional and deep prayer for its whole ministry: for peace in the world, missionary work, Christian unity and economic justice. Both the BAS and the BCP provide propers addressing these concerns. Those from the BAS are noted at the beginning of this Ordo. The BCP propers are noted in the body of the Ordo at the traditional times. The colour of the Ember Days is traditionally violet. Those following the BCP custom of a Pentecost Octave wear red for the Ember Days in that week. When the Ember Days are kept at local or diocesan discretion, it may preferable to use the colour of the season."

The reason seems to have been the Memory of the two bishops together attending the 14th General Synod of the Canadian church in 1937, even though China and Japan were then at war. Their lives and episcopal ministries otherwise diverged. Hence, in FAS Tsen and Sasaki are each accorded a separate set of Propers. If FAS is used, and a full commemoration of either is desired (i.e., proper readings and/ or prayers), it may be appropriate to alternate their commemorations—for instance, Paul Sasaki in 2015 and Lindel Tsen in 2016."

    "notes": "The three days before Ascension Day were for many centuries designated as days of special prayer and supplication (“rogare”) for the “seeds sown.” In Canada, with many different climatic zones, a fixed date for such prayer may not always be relevant, hence the BAS does not insist on our keeping to the traditional dates. Another more locally appropriate time may be chosen. However, the agricultural theme of the Rogation Days has in recent years been expanded to include concern for the environment more generally, and so a commonly held season for liturgical expression of such concern may be desirable. Keeping the traditional days after Easter 6 (BCP Easter 5) would seem to address this new insight very well. The liturgical colour may be of the season (white in Eastertide) or violet (the traditional colour of supplication and penitence). The Ember Days of solemn prayer and fasting are traditionally kept at the turn of the four seasons (Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday after Advent 3, Lent 1; the Day of Pentecost and Holy Cross Day). The origins of the tradition are obscure, but in time Ember Days came to be associated almost entirely with solemn prayer for ordinands. In this case the BAS suggests they do not need to be kept at the traditional times, but in relation to local diocesan ordination arrangements. The Ember Days, like Rogation Days, have been de– emphasized in liturgical revision since the 1970s, but there seems to be a reviving sense of their pastoral usefulness. They can be helpful in engaging the church in intentional and deep prayer for its whole ministry: for peace in the world, missionary work, Christian unity, and economic justice. Both the BAS and the BCP provide propers addressing these concerns. Those from the BAS are noted at the beginning of this Ordo. The BCP propers are noted in the body of the Ordo at the traditional times. The colour of the Ember Days is traditionally violet. Those following the BCP custom of a Pentecost Octave wear red for the Ember Days in that week. When the Ember Days are kept at local or diocesan discretion, it may preferable to use the colour of the season."

Note: Where Ps 95 appears as a morning psalm during Lent, the lectionary is asking that this replace the shorter version on p. 49 as the Invitatory. The imposition of ashes is an ancient way to begin the season of Lent. These are often made from branches of palms from the previous year’s Liturgy of the Palms that have been collected and burned, and the residue sifted and cooled, well in advance of Ash Wednesday services. These may be imposed by making a sign of the cross on the forehead, or just a smudge. Or the ashes may be lightly sprinkled on the top of the head. The BAS appoints Ash Wednesday and the other weekdays of Lent and Holy Week, except the Feast of the Annunciation, as Days of Special Devotion. These are observed by special acts of discipline and self–denial. It is customary in many places to suppress the use of “Alleluia” in liturgies during Lent, even on Feast Days and at funerals. This practice can help communities enter more deeply into the spirit of the season, but requires some vigilance. “Praise the Lord” or some version of that phrase is a good substitute. At funerals the Kontakion recommended by the BAS for the Commendation can be replaced by In Paradisum (in English or Latin) or some other suitable hymn or canticle that does not employ the “alleluia.”"

This is a memorial of Christ’s entry into Jerusalem, the episode that marked the beginning of his Passover. But it also includes the reading (or singing) of a complete passion narrative (Matthew, Mark, or Luke according to the three–year cycle). This reading provides the narrative purpose of the week that follows, and dominates the celebration of the day itself, even when the celebration opens with the liturgy of the palms. To reflect this, the BAS gives this Sunday the newer title, “The Sunday of the Passion, with the Liturgy of the Palms.” It is interesting to note that the loss of the title “Palm Sunday” has been addressed in some places by calling the day “Palm Sunday of the Passion.” In one tradition the colour of the Liturgy of the Palms is red and that of the Eucharist, Violet.  The commemoration of William Law, Priest and Spiritual Leader, 1761 is not observed in 2017 or may be transferred to a ferial day."

    "notes": "At the daily office today, Coll 304 will be more suitable when altered as follows: “has left us a meal….” After the liturgy, it is customary to “strip” the altars in preparation for Good Friday. This removal of ornaments and cloths from the church may be accompanied by the reading of Mt 26:30–46 and/or Ps 22.  There should normally be only one celebration of the Eucharist on Maundy Thursday, in the evening. The Triduum, or the great Three Days, the heart of the church’s liturgical year, begins with this liturgy and ends with Evening Prayer on Easter Day. In some dioceses the bishop presides over a “Chrism Mass” in the cathedral earlier on Maundy Thursday at which the oils of chrism and the sick are blessed and (in some places) clergy (sometimes priests and bishops only, sometimes all three orders) renew their ordination vows, reflecting the tradition that the ministerial priesthood was instituted by Our Lord on this day. For practical purposes, this liturgy is sometimes transferred to another day in Holy Week or just before BAS, p. 616). The distinctive features of the Maundy Thursday liturgy in the parish church are the Institution of the Lord’s Supper and the Footwashing. In some places, especially if Holy Communion is to be administered from the Reserved Sacrament on Good Friday, bread (and wine) for this purpose are consecrated at the Maundy Liturgy and at the end of service may be processed to an “altar of repose” where a watch is kept until midnight or longer (representing the Garden of Gethsemane). There is some debate about the “tone” that should be adopted for the Maundy Thursday observances. In a tradition familiar to many, the colour is white and Glory to God in the Highest is sung to the accompaniment of bells, after which the organ and bells are silent until Glory to God reappears at the Great Vigil of Easter. This approach, when carefully planned, deepens our response to the mysteries we celebrate in Holy Week, evoking a kind of restrained joy in thanksgiving for the Lord´s gift to the church of the Holy Eucharist as his Passion begins.  Those who find that this approach to Maundy Thursday interrupts the tone of Holy Week and anticipates the liturgical announcement of the Resurrection on Saturday night at the Vigil adopt Passiontide Red as the colour for the celebration, and the singing of Glory to God in the Highest and the use of bells are omitted. Whichever option is chosen, the centrality of the Eucharist in the life of the church can be celebrated with unrestrained festivity on the feast of Corpus Christi, which is the Thursday after Trinity Sunday (usually transferred to the Sunday following). Corpus Christi is not on the Canadian Calendar, but is observed in a number of places in the Anglican Communion, and Propers are provided in this Ordo when the feast occurs."
